# TDDSnakeFX
A learning project on how Test Driven Development can be used in games based on a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZiCa13y9D4s).

Tests refactored to be written in JUnit 5 and manually adding the hamcrest-core library.

Test code is written for each requirement before they are implemented.

Tests reflect the implementation/specifications of production code.

New functionality/requirements to be added with corresponding JUnit tests.

[Using FXGL 3.9 Game Library](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL).


## Requirements
1. Real-time
2. Snake can move in 4 directions
3. Snake can collide with food
4. Snake can grow
